In this paper we propose a technique to integrate the motion of dynamic objects into a Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm without the need to know a-priori or model the  geometry  of  the  object,  or  even  to  explicitly  estimate  the pose  of  the  object.  The  benefit  of  this  approach  lies  in  a simplification  of  the  underlying  SLAM  state  and  a  resulting simplification  of  the  non-linear  least  squares  optimisation  solution.  We  demonstrate  the  performance  of  the  algorithm  on two scenarios; SLAM in an urban traffic scenario, and extrinsic calibration of a multi RGBD camera system observing a moving object. Our experiments show consistent improvement in robot localisation  and  mapping  accuracy  and  demonstrate  potential of  the  proposed  algorithm.","tags":[],"title":"Exploiting Rigid Body Motion for SLAM in Dynamic Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Classical simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms rely on the static world assumption to formulate the estimation problem, however, the real world has a significant amount of dynamics that can be exploited for a more accurate localization and versatile representation of the environment. In this paper we propose a technique to integrate the motion of dynamic objects into the SLAM estimation problem, without the necessity of estimating the pose or the geometry of the objects. To this end, we introduce a novel representation of the pose change of rigid bodies in motion and show the benefits of integrating such information when performing SLAM in dynamic environments. Our experiments show consistent improvement in robot localization and mapping accuracy when using a simple constant motion assumption, even for objects whose motion slightly violates this assumption","tags":[],"title":"Simultaneous localization and mapping with dynamic rigid objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Classical  simultaneous  local-ization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms make no assumptions about   the   configuration   of   the   points   in   the   environment, however,  real  world  scenes  have  significant  structure  (groundplanes, buildings, walls, ceilings, etc..) that can be exploited. In this paper, we introduce meta-structural information associated with  geometric  primitives  into  the  estimation  problem  and analyze  their  effect  on  the  global  structural  consistency  of the  resulting  map.  Although  we  only  consider  the  effect  of adding planar and orthogonality information for the estimation of  3D  points  in  a  Manhattan-like  world,  this  framework  can be  extended  to  any  type  of  geometric,  kinematic,  dynamic  or even  semantic  information.  We  evaluate  our  approach  on  a city-like  simulated  environment.  We  highlight  the  advantages of  the  proposed  solution  over  SLAM  formulation  considering no prior knowledge about the configuration of 3D points in the environment.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring The Effect of Meta-Structural Information on the Global Consistency of SLAM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mina Henein"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1439171860,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578621460,"objectID":"b3a315424c70ac7961135fba429be899","permalink":"https://minahenein.github.io/project/eth/eth/","publishdate":"2015-08-10T12:57:40+11:00","relpermalink":"/project/eth/eth/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Kinematic Planning for Challenging Maneuvers Of A Quadrupedal Robot","type":"project"}]
