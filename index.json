Classical  simultaneous  local-ization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms make no assumptionsabout   the   configuration   of   the   points   in   the   environment,however,  real  world  scenes  have  significant  structure  (groundplanes, buildings, walls, ceilings, etc..) that can be exploited. Inthis paper, we introduce meta-structural information associatedwith  geometric  primitives  into  the  estimation  problem  andanalyze  their  effect  on  the  global  structural  consistency  ofthe  resulting  map.  Although  we  only  consider  the  effect  ofadding planar and orthogonality information for the estimationof  3D  points  in  a  Manhattan-like  world,  this  framework  canbe  extended  to  any  type  of  geometric,  kinematic,  dynamic  oreven  semantic  information.  We  evaluate  our  approach  on  acity-like  simulated  environment.  We  highlight  the  advantagesof  the  proposed  solution  over  SLAM  formulation  consideringno prior knowledge about the configuration of 3D points in theenvironment.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring The Effect of Meta-Structural Information on the Global Consistency of SLAM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mina Henein"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1439171860,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578621460,"objectID":"b3a315424c70ac7961135fba429be899","permalink":"https://minahenein.github.io/project/eth/eth/","publishdate":"2015-08-10T12:57:40+11:00","relpermalink":"/project/eth/eth/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Kinematic Planning for Challenging Maneuvers Of A Quadrupedal Robot","type":"project"}]
